title: Sirin Wood Side Cheeks

I recently got a Moog Sirin and thought I could spruce it up a bit with some wooden side cheeks. I mean what synth doesn't look good with some side cheeks?! This was a super easy project. First I made a pattern of the side of the Sirin along with the mounting holes. Then I grabbed some mahogany I had lying around and went to my brothers house to use his table saw. A few quick cuts later I had some nice cheeks. All that was left was to drill holes for the mounting screws. 

Here's the final product.

I will probably end up sanding down the hard edges and throwing some finish on it. 

I'm also in progress of building a eurorack synth case. This all started because I wanted a convient way to interface my Yamaha CS-40M with a KeyStep Pro. The CS-40 has a non-standard gate signal level of >3 - 7V note off and <-10 - 0V note on. The KeyStep has a 0-5V, 0-12V gate, and an S-Trig signal. I thought the S-Trig would be what I'd need but the high was 1.25V from what I measured. I built up an op-amp circuit to invert, scale, and offset the KeySteps normal trigger signal. I was planning on wiring it into the trigger circuit but there was not a easy way to do that and I did not want to heavily mod this synth. Also I didn't want to have an external box that needed it's own power and only did this one thing. So enter the world of Eurorack modules. One of the common utility modules in the eurorack landscape is called an attenuverter. It basically does what my original op-amp circuit did but the scaling parameters are adjustable via poteniometers. These modules are used to scale CV and audio voltages in a modular setup either to affect the sound or adjust voltages to make modules compatible with eachother. I will either build my own module or get [this one](https://busycircuits.com/alm010/).

The rails are 84HP wide and from Synthrotek. I will be using a Meanwell RT-65B power supply and a power distribution board from Synthrotek as well. I got the DIY kit of the distro board since it was cheaper and I didn't mind soldering things together.

There are a few things left to do on this case before it is ready for some modules.
* Attach the front, bottom, and rear panels
* Mount the PSU
* Wire up the power switch and socket
* Apply some finish
* Get modules...

That's all for now! I'm hoping to make some updates to the layout of the website soon!
