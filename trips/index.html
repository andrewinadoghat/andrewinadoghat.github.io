	<h2>1 Week Winter Mitteldeutschland Travel Guide</h2> 
	<p>At the end of November 2014 I decided to go on an adventure to Germany at the 
	end/beginning of 2014/2015. That gave me a very short time to get my passport,
	plan the trip, and make arrangments for lodgings and flights. It was successful.
	I have decided to share my plan in case anyone is interested in doing a similar trip. </p>

	<p>A few things first. One, I was traveling by myself so that made emencly easier to plan
	activities and lodgings. Two, I was going during the dead of winter so lodgings were either
	totally closed for the season or had many vacancies. Three, I don't know. </p>
	
	This trip has a few requirements and they are
	<ul>
		<li>Arrive and depart from Frankfurt. You could do it differently if you want and ticket prices.</li>
		<li>A German Rail pass. Seriously the best thing ever. A plus is that they are 25% off at the end of the year.</li>
		<li>A backpack(hiking style) that fits all your stuff and is a carry on. You'll be carrying a lot.</li>
		<li>Winter clothes and shoes that you are comfortable to walk upwards of 10 miles in.</li>
		<li>Maps or directions to your hostels in each city.</li>
	</ul>
	
	Okay, let's begin!<br>

	<h3>Day One (The day you leave the US)</h3>
	<img src="./assets/images/IMG_20150108_165556.jpg" alt="Flight"/><br>
	So hopefully you've gotten a flight that leaves the US in the mid morning so that you can arrive in Germany in the morning as well.
	German is 9 hours (?) ahead of the US and a direct flight is 11 hours.  My flight was not very exciting as it was night most of the time
	beacuse we were delayed by 3+ hours (which totally screwed some of my plans!!).  Day One is basically just sitting in the airport and 
	airplane for who knows how long. I hope you brought something to keep yourself occupied.<br>
	 
	<h3>Day Two (The day you get to Germany.  Frankfurt/Eisenach/Erfurt)</h3>
	So now you're in Germany! Congrats you made it! Now what?! Well do the normal airporty things but don't forget to get your rail pass
	validated so that you can take the train to your first destination. Grab some food and water(I was basically dehydrated when I got there) and head
	to the train station which is connected to airport because Germany has a LEGIT transportation system. Anyways find the trains and take an ICE to 
	Eisenach(a few hour train ride.)  Recover from the flight and enjoy the great German landscape on the train.  We'll be visiting one of the many 
	castles in German.  When you get to Eisenach, you can  either carry your bag or store at the station for some Euros. I'm stingy so I hiked with it.
	It's about an hour hike to the castle (or you could pay 10 Euro to take a taxi, again I'm stingy).  Be prepared for wintery conditions on the hike.
	Make sure to stop at Bach's house on your way to the castle. Check out the castle and then head back to the train station hopefully before it gets 
	too dark!!  There are trains every ~45 minutes to Erfurt so catching a train won't be an issue.  This time you can just a regular train.  When you
	get to Erfurt you can either get some dinner now or after you've checked into your hostel. <br> 
	
	<h3>Day Three (The day you get to Berlin. Erfurt/Wittenburg/Berlin)</h3>
	<img src="./assets/images/IMG_20150110_100351.jpg" alt="Erfurter Dom"/><br>
	Hey you've survived your first full full day in Germany!! Now go get some awesome breakfast in your hostel. When you're done, mull around Erfurt
	checking out the sights until noonish.  Take a train to Berlin(the right one if you want to see Wittenburg or any other city on the way to Berlin.).  I took the wrong one because I hadn't
	figured out the train kiosks yet. Anyways that turned out to be a blessing because a storm blew in as I arrived in Berlin. I had an 'adventure'
	finding my hostel in Berlin (<b>The Circus Hostel</b>, highly recommend). I was going off my mental map of Berlin and took a few wrong turns but got 
	there as soon as it started pouring!  Check into your hostel and then grab some dinner and explore Berlin for the night but remember to take a map 
	so you don't get lost...make it back to your hostel and sleep. <br>
	
	<h3>Day Four (The day you explore Berlin. Berlin)</h3>
	<img src="./assets/images/IMG_20150111_192107.jpg" alt="Brandenburg Tor"/><br>
	I went to church this day and hung out with new friends that I met. Do this. This is awesome. I was back to my hostel by late afternoon. I had some
	dinner and explored Berlin at night again. The hostel gave me an epic map so I was able to pick out some cool places to <br>
	
	<h3>Day Five (The day you explore something to the West of Berlin. Berlin/Postdam)</h3>
	<img src="./assets/images/IMG_20150112_115821.jpg" alt="Schloss"/><br>
	Take a train to Postdam to explore an epic Prussian palace. It is spread across a huge park/garden with multiple beautiful palaces and other buildings. 
	grab some food somewhere in town or the station while you are exploring.  I also checked out a sweet science park that had some of Germany's climate
	research centers.  It also had some rad observatories (albeit closed on cloudy Monday morning).  <br>
	<img src="./assets/images/IMG_20150112_142416.jpg" alt="Observatory"/><br>
	<h3>Day Six (The day you explore more of Berlin. Berlin)</h3>
	This was a Tuesday for me.  I had two goals.  Go to the free concert at the Berlin Philharmonic(every Tuesday at Lunch) and get a Doener Kebab at Mustafas.
	I explored the Tiergarten and saw some other sights in the morning. I made it to the concert but I never found Mustafas(I missed it by one street! :( ).  <br>

	<img src="./assets/images/IMG_20150113_114251.jpg" alt="Christmas Tree"/><br>
	<h3>Day Seven (The day you leave Berlin. Berlin/Koeln)</h3>
	Get to your train on time and don't talk to strangers.  Enjoy a nice 4 hour train ride to Koeln, this doesn't leave you very much time to see Koeln.  Have some Currywurst at the station in Koeln when you arrive.
	Check out the Cathedral and other cool things on your way to your hostel (<b>The Wohnegemeinshaft</b>).  After checking in, explore Koeln at night and grab some dinner. Then sleep.<br>
	<img src="./assets/images/IMG_20150114_155942.jpg" alt="Koeln Dom"/><br>
	<h3>Day Eight (The day you see Castles. Koeln/Bacharach)</h3>
	Wake up and have some excellent German breakfast.  Catch the slow train down the River Rhine.  This relaxing train ride is full of awesome sights.
	I got out at one of the stops and had a pinic at a castle on the hill above the town. There are many stops and most of the towns have castles in them.
	After that short respite, I boarded the train again to finish the trip to Bacharach.  In Bacharach, I stayed in castle that was converted to a hostel!
	It was more tailored to school kids and families but I thought it was awesome.  It had great views of the valley.  So grab a nice dark German Bier and 
	sit back and enjoy the beautiful scenary on your last full day in Germany.<br>
	<img src="./assets/images/IMG_20150115_154235.jpg" alt="Castle"/><br>
	<h3>Day Nine (The day you leave the Germany. Bacharach/Frankfurt)</h3>
	Don't be sad. This was awesome.  Get up really early and get on the train to Frankfurt with all the school childern and business people.  Get off at the 
	airport and check in and whatnot. Fly Home.<br><br>
	
	Challenges that I experienced
