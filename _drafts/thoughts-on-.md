I've been thinking a lot lately. Granted we are in a pandemic right now so I've got time for that. But really, it started before that. What may you ask have I been thinking about... creativity, focus, consuming vs producing, learning. 	

So consuming versus producing. I've been thinking about this in regards to the information or content that I have . 

It's 

What

Why

I look back to my colleges days and see all the content I was producing and compare to what I am doing now. It's a stark contrast. 

Checking instagram had become a habit for me. I did not think much of it at time until I started thinking about how I was spending my time and what automatic responses I had developed. I realized that if I had a free moment I would flip open Insta and mindlessly scroll for a bit. A completely passive activity. I was subsituting active thinking for mindless scrolling. I had become a passive consumer of content. 

In college, before Instagram, I read interesting blogs like [hackaday](https://hackaday.com) or [Hackedgadgets](http://hackedgadgets.com/) or one of the many interesting blogs from other college students at the time [Charles](http://www.etotheipiplusone.net/) or [Kenneth](https://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com/). Those blogs fueled my creativity and pushed me to pursue my own projects.
